>Knowledge gained :
### There are lot of things which i learn by doing this Project.
- Successfully implementing [ Google Fonts ](https://fonts.google.com/) on my Web Page.
- For Horizontal Alignment of List we used : “display inline” property :
```
li
{
display:inline-block;
}

```
- For Smooth Transitions between two or more specified colors we use CSS Gradient.
- Gradient Overlay : Adding a Gadient to an Image  <br/>
The Code we used :
```
.container
{
background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(24, 27, 95, 0.793), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.787)),

url("../images/background.png");

background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

```
- background-size property :
    The background-size property specifies the size of the background images. </br>
    There are four different syntaxes you can use with this property: the keyword syntax ("auto", "cover" and "contain")
    
    implementation:

```
.hero-image
 {
  background-image: url("background.png"); /* The image used */
  
  background-position: center; /* Center the image */
  
  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Do not repeat the image */
  
  background-size: cover; /* Resize the background image to 
  cover the entire container */
}
```

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
